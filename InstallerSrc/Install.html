<h1>Art of Illusion 2.8 Installer for Linux and Windows</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This installer will install Art of Illusion on a Linux or Windows system.
Please carefully read instructions concerning installation of extensions such as the Java Media Framework.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The installer provides installation of:</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>AoI base system</b></dt>
	<dd>All you need to run Art of Illusion on a standalone basis. The following important features are not included with the base system and must be specified at install time</dd>
<dt><b>Java OpenGL (JOGL)</b></dt>
	<dd><b>Linux</b>: Provided the video drivers you use feature OpenGL, this extension will bring hardware acceleration to 3D modelling. i586 and AMD64 binaries are proposed, but choose only one of the two packages.</dd>
	<dd><b>Windows</b>: This extension will bring hardware acceleration to 3D editing manipulations. Only i586 binaries are proposed at this time.</dd>
<dt><b>Desktop Integration</b></dt>
	<dd><b>Linux</b>: If you use Gnome/KDE and select desktop integration at install time, AoI files (bearing the .aoi extension) will display a nice icon. Double clicking on the file will
	open it with Art of Illusion. A menu item will be available in the "Graphics" section of the
	Applications menu and a desktop icon will be created.</dd>
	<dd><b>Windows</b>: Art of Illusion will be available in the Start menu as well as a desktop shortcut if you select this option at install time.</dd>
<dt><b>Java Media Framework (JMF)</b></dt>
	<dd>The JMF enables you to save animations using the Quicktime video format. If the JMF is missing, then
	animations can only be saved as a collection of still images. See relevant section for JMF installation.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Java Media Framework</h2>
<p>The JMF files can't be distributed along Art of Illusion for legal matters, but here's nonetheless a simple
way to make it work with AoI. The first step is to download the JMF <b>for all Java</b> archive zip file from
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/2.1.1/download.html">Sun's site</a>
(<b>http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/2.1.1/download.html</b>).</p>
<p><b>Linux</b>: If the JMF package is selected at installation time, the installer will ask you where you save the zip file
obtained from Sun. Select the JMF zip: that's all you have to care about! </p>
<p><b>Requirements: unzip command must be available so that the JMF extension can be installed.</b></p>
<p><b>Windows</b>: you will have to unzip the archive using your favourite unzip utility and extract jmf.jar to where Art of Illusion has been installed (most likely C:\Program Files\ArtOfIllusion).</p>
<p>The JMF extension will take about 2Mb disk space once installed</p>

<h2>Installation is finished, where to go now ?</h2>
Well you can have a nice go at the Hourglass tutorial, a very famous beginner tutorial. And pay a visit
to the <a href="http://aoisp.sourceforge.net">Scripts and Plugins repository</a> where some very
handy extensions are available. Installation of these extensions is very simple : select the Scripts
and Plugins Manager from the Tools menu. Select the install tab and choose any script or plugin you want
to install. It's as simple as that...
