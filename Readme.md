# Art of Illusion

Art of Illusion is a free, multiplatform Modeling, Animation and
Rendering suite written in the java language. It features a simple,
streamlined interface to a broad array of powerful features, including
keyframe and pose based animations, as well as a built-in raytracer.

AOI is extensible both through plugins (many are available through our
in-application manager) and an integrated scripting environment.
