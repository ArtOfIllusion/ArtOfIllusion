###Art of Illusion###

Art of Illusion is a free, multiplatform Modeling, Animation and Rendering suite written in the java language. It features a simple, streamlined interface to a broad array of powerful features, including keyframe and pose based animations, an integrated scripting environment, and a built in raytracer.
