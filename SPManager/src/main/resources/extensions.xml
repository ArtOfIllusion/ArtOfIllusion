The Script and Plugin Manager is a plugin that makes the management of scripts and plugins easy.
It scans for updates of installed scripts/plugins and shows all the not-yet-installed items
available at repositories. 
It's probably the tool you're using at this very moment !

See http://aoisp.sourceforge.net/spmanagement.html for usage.
